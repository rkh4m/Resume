# Resume Project

Created a resume using LaTeX in the software "TeXworks" with a template provided by: https://github.com/arasgungore/arasgungore-CV.

Opted to use LaTeX instead of word processing software like Word or Docs for:
- the customization offered by LaTeX
- the ability to save previous entries while maintaing a page-long resume (via commenting out unused entries)
- the chance to learn a language used for all kinds of documentation purposes
